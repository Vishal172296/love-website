  <h2>My Love Letter To You, Priya 💌</h2>

  <p>
    Priya, from the day we chose each other on <b>12 July 2025</b>, my world quietly changed.
    You became the thought behind my smiles, the calm behind my chaos,
    and the reason I believe in love a little more every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have loved deeply, and we have fought fiercely.
    There were moments when words hurt, when silence felt heavy,
    but even in those moments, my heart never stopped choosing you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Loving you taught me that love isn’t about perfection.
    It’s about patience, effort, forgiveness,
    and staying even when things get hard.
  </p>

  <p>
    I promise effort, honesty, patience, and loyalty.
    I promise to love you in every version of us.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you ever doubt us, scroll back up and remember
    how far we’ve come and how deeply I love you.
  </p>

  <p class="sign">
    Forever yours,<br>
    <b>Vishal ❤️</b>
